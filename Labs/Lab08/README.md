# Lab 08

## Lab Procedure

**For each step, include the command you used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.** If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.  
`ssh` in to your AWS environment. If you've forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../..) for instructions.

1. Go to the folder in which you cloned your Git repository for this course.
   - Path of `/home/ubuntu/spring2021-ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/` OR `/home/ubuntu/git/spring2021-ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/` depending on your setup
2. Create a directory called `Lab08`
   - Path of `/home/ubuntu/spring2021-ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/Lab08` OR `/home/ubuntu/git/spring2021-ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/Lab08` depending on your setup
3. In this directory, create a file called `README.md`
4. This `README.md` file is where you will put your answers to this lab. I recommend creating two connections to your Linux AWS so you can keep the `README.md` file open while you expirement with the lab.
   - At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:

```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email

```

## Part 1: To Infinity (2 pts)

1. In your `Lab08` folder, create a script called `infinity`.
2. Each time the loop runs it should do the following (2 pts)
   - Output a statement such as "Still going!" to a file called `still-going.txt`
   - Sleep for 15 seconds
   - Repeat. Infinitely!

## Part 2: Terminally Attached (5 pts)

1. Connect to your AWS system in two different terminals. (1 pt)
   - The PID of the terminal you will monitor processes on is: 
   - The PID of the terminal you will expirement with running your script is: 
2. Run the script you created in your terminal. Note the PID. Kill the process and write the command you used. (1 pt)
3. Run your script with `source`. Note the PID.  (1 pt)
   - If you kill this process, what will happen?  
   - Kill the process and write the command you used.
4. Run the script in the background using `bg`. (2 pts)
   - Note the PID and the background ID. 
   - Kill the background process via the job ID and write the command you used.

## Part 3: Terminally Detached (3 pts)

1. Run your script in `screen`. Write the command(s) to set up a `screen` session, run your script inside, and detach from `screen`. (1 pt)
2. Use `exit` to disconnect from the terminal.  The other terminal can stay open (if it was still open).  Does the other terminal also know about your `screen` session?
3. Go back in, reattach to your `screen` and write the command(s) you used. (1 pt)
4. End the `screen` session and write the command(s) you used. (1 pt)

## Part 4: The better `marco` `polo` (4 pts)
1. In your `Lab08` folder, create a script called `marco` and a script called `polo`
2. Modify `PATH` to use this directory instead of the old one.  Write what you did. (1 pt)
3. Modify `marco` so that when it is run, it should save the current working directory in a file so that `polo` can reference it. (1 pt)
   - You may refer back to your work in `Lab04`
4. Modify polo so that when it is run, it should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. (1 pt)
  - Hint: For `polo` to work in your shell, you are going to have to run it differently than `marco`.  The shell you are running in is the parent shell.  When you execute a script, it does its work in a "subshell".  If you run `polo` on its own, it might not create errors, but it also won't change into the directory in your shell, the parent shell - it did the action in the subshell!  To make it do the action in our shell, the parent shell, play with using `source` or `.`  
5. Write a basic `How To` guide for your `marco` and `polo` script here, including how to run each. (1 pt)

## Part 5: The Git Part (1 pt)

1. Use `git` commands to `add`, `commit` and `push` the `Lab08` folder to GitHub.

## Extra Credit: Conflict Resolution (2 pts)

Last week you played with branching.  That was wonderful, but you got the feeling there may be problems looming on the horizon.  Among those problems is dealing with merge conflicts, where there exist two versions of the same file, and only one may survive.  So, you are going to pick one of the following strategies to create a merge conflict, then you are going to resolve the conflict.

Documentation (and answers to questions) should be in your `Lab08` `README.md` file under the `Extra Credit` section at the end.  Note which option you ran with.

- **Option A: Conflict between branches**
   - Confirm you are on the `main` branch of your repository.
   - Create a new file in your `Lab08` folder called `problem-child.txt`  Add some text to this file, just to get the party started.
   - `add`, `commit` and `push` the file, and confirm you see the file on GitHub.
   - Create / switch to a new branch called `improvements`
   - Edit `problem-child.txt` in the `improvements` branch.
   - `commit` and `push`.  Write the command to push this branch to GitHub
   - Switch back to the `main` branch
   - Don't `merge` yet - you'll ruin the expirement
   - Making sure you are on the `main` branch, make some edits to `problem-child.txt`
   - Now `merge` the `improvements` branch with `main`
   - Summarize the output from making the `merge` between the two branches.
   - Head to your file in the terminal.  What do you see?
   - Resolve your conflict by modifying the file to no longer have the scary >>'s of doom and have the content you want to keep.
   - Run `status`.  Summarize the output given and what you need to do next now that your file is in a happy state.
   - Do the things.  Write the command(s) you used.
- **Option B: Conflict from remote**
   - Confirm you are on the `main` branch of your repository
   - Create a new file in your `Lab08` folder called `problem-child.txt`  Add some text to this file, just to get the party started.
   - `add`, `commit` and `push` the file, and confirm you see the file on GitHub.
   - Make more edits to the file via your terminal.  You may `commit`, but don't `push` - you'll ruin the expirement.
   - In GitHub, click into the file, then click the little edit button.  Make some edits, then `commit` to `main` at the bottom of the page.
   - Now, back in your terminal, try to `push` those changes.  What is the result?
   - Why do you need to `pull`?
   - Summarize the output given by `pull`
   - Head to your file in the terminal.  What do you see?
   - Resolve your conflict by modifying the file to no longer have the scary >>'s of doom and have the content you want to keep.
   - Run `status`.  Summarize the output given and what you need to do next now that your file is in a happy state.
   - Do the things.  Write the command(s) you used.

- Don't forget to `commit` and `push` your updates to the `README.md` file for grading.
